Software Development Process at Thriv
Introduction
To address the evolving software development demands at Thriv, we recognize the urgency for a more systematic approach to product development. Our approach ensures:

Efficient resource allocation.
Alignment with key business objectives.
An increased likelihood of project fruition.
Clear Ownership Through Development Phases
A delineated ownership structure at each phase guarantees accountability, ensures smooth communication, and establishes distinct transition points.

Idea Emergence: Spearheaded by the Product Team.
PRD Creation: A collaborative effort between the Product Team, stakeholders, and CEO (Alex Weber).
Technical Design: Anchored by the Lead Engineer with backing from the engineering division.
Engineering Handoff: A joint transition between the Lead Engineer and the Engineering Team.
1. Product Requirement Document (PRD) Creation
Participants: Product team, stakeholders, and CEO, Alex Weber.

Steps:

Understand the underlying business issue or opportunity.
Define the product's core objectives and requirements.
Identify the target audience and their needs.
Detail desired features, constraints, and success markers.
Objective: A concise document representing the vision of the upcoming product or feature.

2. Technical Design Document Creation
Steps:

The lead engineer translates the PRD into a comprehensive technical design document.
This document showcases the system architecture, data designs, algorithm choices, and other technical specifics.
Objective: A clear guide for the engineering brigade, elucidating the product or feature's construction.

3. Feedback Iteration
Significance: Routine feedback helps maintain alignment between product and engineering wings, allowing early flagging of possible obstacles.

Cadence: Feedback sessions are scheduled after both the PRD and the design document are finalized, and recur throughout the development cycle.

Participants: Senior and lead engineers, the product group, stakeholders, and occasionally the CEO.

Anticipated Outcomes:

Detection of discrepancies or oversights.
Proposals for enhancements.
Sharper understanding of challenges and potential risks.
Adaptability to Evolving Business Needs
The dynamic nature of business demands agility. However, adaptability shouldn't translate to resource wastage or protracted tasks being altered capriciously. It's crucial that any changes made respect ongoing processes and consider the implications. Executive decisions should be made transparently, with a commitment to communication, to ensure all teams can pivot efficiently without derailing progress.

Conclusion
Embracing this streamlined strategy assures a cohesive product development pathway. It ensures that our tech endeavors align with business aims and makes optimal use of resources. Regular feedback loops further refine and elevate the end product's quality and relevance.
